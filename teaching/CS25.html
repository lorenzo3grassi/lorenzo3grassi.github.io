This page belongs to course 2MBD60 - Introduction to cryptology. 
This course is offered at TU/e as part of the bachelor's elective 
package 
<a class="hlink" href="https://eipsi.win.tue.nl/security-package/">Security</a>
and used to be called 2WF80 - Introduction to Cryptology. For the 2025/26
edition there is no difference between the courses.

<a name="contents"></a>
<p>
<b>Contents</b><br> 
<ul>
<li> Introduction to symmetric cryptography, public-key cryptography, and digital signature schemes </li>
<li> Classical ciphers (Caesar cipher, Vigenère, Playfair, rotor machines, ...) </li>
<li> Shift Register Sequences and RC4 </li>
<li> Block cipher DES and mode of operations (ECB, CBC, ...)</li>
<li> Hash functions and Message Authentication Code (MAC) </li>
<li> RSA encryption and signature</li>

<li> Cryptanalysis by using statistics, factorization, ... </li>
<li> Secret sharing </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Some words up front: Crypto is an exciting area of research. Learning
crypto makes you more aware of the limitations of security and privacy 
which might make you feel <i>less</i> secure but that's just a more 
accurate impression of reality and it a good step to improve your
security.<br>
</p>


<a name="ann"></a> <h4> Announcements</h4>
<p>
If you study mathematics, you should have participated in "2WF50 - Algebra" 
and "2WF70 - Algorithmic algebra and number theory".<br>
If you study computer science or any other program you should have
participated in "2DBI00 - Linear Algebra and Applications",
"2IT50 or 2IT80 - Discrete structures", and
"2WF90 - Algebra
for security" before taking this course.<br>

If not, you can find some material in the <a class="hlink" href="#bib">Literature</a> section,
but note that you are on your own for learning this.
</p>

<p>
Lectures take place on Monday (block 3 and 4) 
and on Thursday (block 7 and 8). 
Instruction sessions take place on Thursday (block 5 and 6).
<!-- Because more students signed up than the schedulers
assumed we have a bit of an odd mix of lecture rooms, please check the online
calendar. -->
<!--
We have three locations for the instruction sessions (Thu block 5 and 6),
 namely Luna 1.240, and Altas 4.215 (except for Nov 16 when it is Atlas
-1.820); 
please join the room that's emptier. We might reduce to two rooms if not enough
students show up, but . --> I really recommend doing the instruction sessions and
attending them live if you can fit them in your agenda. They are more important
than the lecture, and thus get the prime spot. We'll have enough instructors in
the rooms so that you can ask your questions and check the answers to your
exercises with them. We will not hand out solutions.
<!--In 2020 and 2021 the course has been
running online with short videos &ndash; one video per topic,
so several videos per unit. 
This year two of the Monday lectures will be streamed and recorded because we
couldn't get a big enough room, but most lectures happen only in person.-->

Please always inlcude all 6 of them when you send in your homeworks - and make
sure that you encrypt to all 6 of them and to your team mates. (Please, do <b>not</b> send your homeworks to Prof. Lorenzo Grassi.) All email
systems that I know of will do this automatically if you have all keys in your
address book and the people in the To or Cc field your email.

<p>
It is <i>not</i> necessary to purchase any book to follow the course. 
</p>

<p>
For easy prototyping of crypto implementations, I suggest the computer algebra system <a class="hlink"
 href="http://sagemath.org/">Sage</a>. It is based on
python and you can use it online or install it on your computer (in a
virtual box in case you're running windows). See this <a class="hlink"
 href="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/92qhT8BAdRk">video</a> for a demonstration on how to use Sage <a class="hlink"
 href="https://www.sagemath.org/">https://www.sagemath.org/</a> (by Prof. Tanja Lange - it also covers basics of finite fields and
elliptic curves). Prof. Tanja Lange also wrote a short ``cheat sheet'' with commands for Sage, 
see <a class="hlink"
href="/teaching/sage-ref.pdf">here</a>.
</p>

<p>For encrypting your homeworks you should use GPG/PGP. If you're
running Linux then GNU uPG is easy to install. 
<a class="hlink" href="https://mailvelope.com/en'>https://mailvelope.com/en</a> is a browser
plugin for using PGP gor web-based mails. If you're using windows you can use
<a class="hlink" href="http://www.gpg4win.org/">GPG4win</a>; if
you're using MAC-OS you can use <a class="hlink" href="https://gpgtools.org/">GPG
Suite</a> (though I'm getting reports that they changed their system and now
charge for the full version, the command-line linux version works for sure).<br>
Thunderbird has good integration and I hear that also outlook can
work well with the plugins.</p>

<p>
Please always inlcude all 6 of them when you send in your homeworks - and make
sure that you encrypt to all 6 of them and to your team mates. (Please, do <b>not</b> send your homeworks to Prof. Lorenzo Grassi.) All email
systems that I know of will do this automatically if you have all keys in your
address book and the people in the To or Cc field your email. The teaching assistants from 2023 wrote
<a class="hlink"
href="/teaching/PK/Guide-to-Homework-submission-Introduction-to-Cryptology.pdf">this
guide</a> to homework submission for this course.<br>

If absolutely not possible otherwise, we are OK with having only the attachment being  
encrypted and signed, but prefer proper encryption of the whole email. If you
end up going for file encryption only you must ensure that all receipients can
decrypt and you're missing out on the support that the email system offers you.
</p>

<a name="exam"></a>
<h4>Examination</h4>
<p>
30% of the grade is determined by homeworks. There will be six
sets of homework during the quarter. You should hand in your homework
in groups of 3 or 4. To make sure that you get used to crypto we require
solutions to be sent encrypted and signed with GPG/PGP. Each participant must
have communicated with the TAs at least once using GPG/PGP.
You can find the keys for the TAs linked above.<br>
</p>

<p>
Date of the Exam: to be announced.
</p>

<a name="video"></a> <h4>Videos and slides</h4> 
<p>
For 2022 and 2023 the lectures were recorded 
and posted at 
<a class="hlink"
href="https://tue.video.yuja.com/P/VideoManagement/MediaLibrary/search?query=(2WF80)">TU/e's
Yuja site</a>. Search for course code 2WF80 (the old name of this course) to
see the recordings. Courses from Prof. Tanja Lange are the 2022/23 and 2023/24 versions, not the 2018/19
version which for some reason laods with preview. Click on the three vertical
dots on the right end of the course to select "open" and get to the videos.
<br>
For the 2020 and 2021 editions of the course, Prof. Tanja Lange recorded a lot of short videos
which you can find on the <a class="hlink"
href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6crzceuaPCsST472Z_hT3Q?pbjreload=102">YouTube
Channel</a> which are better for self study or if you want a more direct way to
look up a subject.
The 
<a class="hlink" href=https://www.hyperelliptic.org/tanja/teaching/CS21/>course page for 2021</a> has short descriptions of all videos, slides,
 and no-cookie links to the YouTube videos.
